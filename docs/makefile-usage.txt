Rules:
   * compile       - Compiles the project.
   * package       - Creates archived package of compiled classes.
                        WARNING: Project need to be compiled first!
   * clean         - Cleans all of compiled classes and created jar.
   * cleanbin      - Cleans all compiled classes files only.
   * check-verbose - Checks the verbose status.
   * usage         - Prints the example usages for build the project.
   * build-docs    - Builds the JMatrix's HTML pages of javadocs.

Additional Options:
  - Activating verbose output

      $ export VERBOSE=true && make [rules]

    Or:

      $ make [rules] VERBOSE=true


  - Include source files while packaging

      $ make [rules] INCLUDE-SRC=true


  - Invoke the linter

      $ make [rules] LINT=true


  - Add some options or flags to compiler

      $ make compile FLAGS[=<flags>]

Usage:
    $ make [rules] [...] [arguments]
    $ make [rules] [VERBOSE[=<bool>] | INCLUDE-SRC[=<bool>]]
    $ make [rules] (LINT[=<bool>] | FLAGS[=<flags>])

Tips:
    - Combine the rules, `Make` can understands multiple rules.
      Except for `build-docs` rule, built as standalone rule.
