[1mAdditional Options:[0m
  - Activating verbose output

      $ export VERBOSE=true && make [rules]

    Or:

      $ make [rules] VERBOSE=true


  - Include source files while packaging

      $ make [rules] INCLUDE-SRC=true


  - Invoke the linter

      $ make [rules] LINT=true


  - Add some options or flags to compiler

      $ make compile FLAGS[=<flags>]

[1mTips:[0m
    - Combine the rules; `Make` can understand multiple rules.
      Except for `build-docs` rule, it should be built as a standalone rule.
