Rules:
   * compile       - Compile the program.
   * package       - Create archived package (jar) of compiled program.
                        WARNING: Program need to be compiled first!
   * clean         - Clean all of compiled program and created jar.
   * cleanbin      - Clean all generated class files only.
   * check-verbose - Check the verbose status.
   * usage         - Print the example usages for build the project.
   * build-docs    - Build the JMatrix's HTML pages of javadocs.

Additional Options:
  - Activating verbose output

      `export VERBOSE=true && make [rules]`

    Or:

      `make [rules] VERBOSE=true`


  - Include source files while packaging

      `make [rules] INCLUDE-SRC=true`


  - Invoke the linter

      `make [rules] LINT=true`


  - Add some options or flags to compiler

      `make compile FLAGS[=<flags>]`

Usage:
    $ make [rules] [...] [arguments]
    $ make [rules] [VERBOSE[=<bool>] | INCLUDE-SRC[=<bool>]]
    $ make [rules] (LINT[=<bool>] | FLAGS[=<flags>])

Tips:
  - Combine the rules, `Make` can understand multiple rules.
