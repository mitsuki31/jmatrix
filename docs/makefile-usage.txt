Usage:
   $ make [rules] [...] [options] [...]

Rules:
   build-docs     - Builds the HTML pages of JMatrix's javadocs.
   check-verbose  - Checks the verbose status.
   clean          - Cleans the working directory thoroughly.
   cleanbin       - Cleans all compiled class files only.
   cleandocs      - Cleans all generated HTML documentations only.
   compile        - Compiles all project's source files (.java).
   package        - Creates archived package of compiled classes.
   usage          - Prints the basic usages for building the project.

Options:
   FLAGS - Append flags to specific command or rule.

       Example:
           $ make [rules] FLAGS[=<flags>]


   INCLUDE-SRC - Whether to include the source files while packaging.

       Example:
           $ make package INCLUDE-SRC[=<bool>]


   LINT - Whether to invoke the linter during the compilation.

       Example:
           $ make compile LINT[=<bool>]


   VERBOSE - Whether to activate the verbose output.

       Example:
           $ export VERBOSE[=(<bool>|all)] && make [rules] [options]
           $ make [rules] VERBOSE[=<bool>]
           $ make build-docs VERBOSE[=(<bool>|all)]

       Only the build-docs rule that has 3 verbose modes:
           - Quiet Mode:   *no argument
           - Normal Mode:  VERBOSE=true
           - All Mode:     VERBOSE=all

Tips:
    Combine the rules; Make can understand multiple rules.
    Except for build-docs rule, it was built as a standalone rule.
