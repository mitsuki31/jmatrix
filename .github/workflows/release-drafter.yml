# The "Release Drafter" workflow automates the process of drafting
# new releases by generating release notes based on pull requests
# and commits. This workflow is triggered when changes are pushed to
# the `master` branch and when pull requests are opened, reopened,
# or synchronized.
#
# This workflow streamlines the process of creating informative and organized
# release notes for each new version of the project. It ensures that
# the release notes accurately reflect the changes introduced by pull requests
# and commits, enhancing transparency and communication with users and contributors.
#
