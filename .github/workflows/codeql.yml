# This workflow focuses on enhancing code security and identifying
# potential vulnerabilities in the Java codebase. The workflow is triggered
# by push events to the "master" and "release" branches, as well as by
# a weekly schedule. It targets Java source files located in the "src" directory.
#
# This workflow is crucial for maintaining code security and quality by
# regularly analyzing the Java codebase for vulnerabilities and providing
# insights to address potential security issues.
#
# The workflow runs on both Ubuntu and Windows platforms for comprehensive
# code portability checks.
