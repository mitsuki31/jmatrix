## <a name="constructor-summary" /> Constructor Summary
There are 5 constructors that can be used for constructing the matrix.  
> :man::question: Still don't understand about matrix? Check the [:bookmark:Introduction to Matrix][what-is-matrix] page
> to get little knowledge about matrix before dive into matrix constructor.

### <a name="cr_matrix-1" /> `Matrix()`
This constructor doesn't need any arguments, but it would constructs the **Matrix**
with `null` entries or can be called **null matrix**. In this case, the matrix itself can't do any operations until
get initialized and have valid elements. For example:

```java
// Create null entries matrix
Matrix m = new Matrix();
```

> **Note**  
> Don't be confused with **null matrix** and **zero matrix**.  
> **Null matrix** is a matrix that has `null` entries, whereas the **zero matrix** is a matrix with all elements are zero.


> <details><summary><b>Examples</b></summary>
>
> ### Zero Matrix
>
> ```math
> \begin{bmatrix}
>   0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
>   0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0
> \end{bmatrix}_{2 \times 3}
> ```
>
> ### Null Matrix
>
> ```java
> null
> ```
>
> Yes, that is a **null matrix**. It has none or `null` entries inside the matrix. The output above is the result of this code below:
>
> ```java
> Matrix nullM = new Matrix();
> System.out.println(
>     (nullM.getEntries() == null) ? nullM.getEntries() : nullM.toString());
> ```
>
> </details> 


### <a name="cr_matrix-2"></a> `Matrix(int, int)`
How to create **zero matrix**? Don't worry, with this constructor you can construct **zero matrix** with ease.
With just two arguments, each for size of [row][matrix-row] and [column][matrix-col].  
The matrix can be called **zero matrix** if all elements inside the matrix is zero.
For example:

```java
// Create null matrix with size 3x4
Matrix m = new Matrix(3, 4);
```

The code above will construct a new **zero matrix** with size $3 \times 4$. The matrix will looks like this:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

### <a name="cr_matrix-3" /> `Matrix(int, int, int)`
This constructor is similar with [`Matrix(int, int)`](#cr_matrix-2) but with an additional
argument which is the value to filled out the entire elements of constructed matrix. For example:

```java
// Create new matrix with size 4x4 and 5 as default elements
Matrix m = new Matrix(4, 4, 5);
```

The constructed matrix above will looks like this:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 \\
  5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 \\
  5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 \\
  5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

### <a name="cr_matrix-4" /> `Matrix(double[][])`
This constructor is very **RECOMMENDED** for constructing a new [matrix][what-is-matrix].  
It because you can declare the entries first, and then you can convert it to **Matrix** object whenever you want.
For example:

```java
// Declare and initialize entries "a"
double[][] a = {
    { 1, 2, 3 },
    { 4, 5, 6 }
};

// Convert to Matrix
Matrix m = new Matrix(a);
```

Or you can do the same thing with this code:

```java
// Create new matrix
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 1, 2, 3 },
    { 4, 5, 6 }
});
```

### <a name="cr_matrix-5" /> `Matrix.identity(int)`
This constructor would creates new **identity matrix** with size $n \times n$ (the $n$ is from input).  
**Identity matrix** itself is a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. And the **identity matrix** is often denoted by $I$.  
> **Note**  
> In code you should avoid using neither $I$ nor $i$ for the **Matrix**'s variable name, it because $i$ is often used by `for-loop` statement.  
> Instead you can use $mI$ or similar with that.  

For example:

```java
// Create new identity matrix with size 5x5
Matrix mI = Matrix.identity(5);
```

The matrix will looks like this:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0
\end{bmatrix}
```


## <a name="matrix-ops" /> Matrix Operations

There are some basic matrix operations provided by **JMatrix**:

- [Addition](#matrix-add)
- [Subtraction](#matrix-sub)
- [Scalar Multiplication](#scalar-mult)
- [Matrix Multiplication](#matrix-mult)
- [Transposition](#matrix-transpose)

Please refer to [:books: JMatrix Wikis][matrix-ops], for more detailed about matrix operations.

### <a name="matrix-add" /> Addition

:book: **Wiki:** [Matrix Addition][matrix-add]

> **Note**  
> Ensure the two matrices are same dimensions before operating **addition**.

**Example code:**
```java
// Construct new matrices
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 6, 7, 0, 1 },
    { 2, 6, 1, 8 }
});

Matrix n = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 1, 9, 3, -4 },
    { 7, 1, -1, 5 }
});

// Operate addition for both matrices and
// create a new matrix as the resultant matrix
Matrix k = Matrix.sum(m, n);
```

**Result:**
```math
\mathbf{k} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  7.0 & 16.0 & 3.0 & -3.0 \\
  9.0 & 7.0 & 0.0 & 13.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

### <a name="matrix-sub" /> Subtraction

:book: **Wiki:** [Matrix Subtraction][matrix-sub]

> **Note**  
> Ensure the two matrices are same dimensions before operating subtraction.

**Example code:**
```java
// Construct new matrices
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 1, -5, 8, -2, 3 },
    { 2, 12, -2, 7, 0 },
    { 6, 7, 9, 1, -5 }
});

Matrix n = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 4, 6, 8, -3, 9 },
    { -10, 6, 8, 1, 1 },
    { 6, -7, 2, 3, 5 }
});

// Operate subtraction for both matrices and
// create a new matrix as the resultant matrix
Matrix k = Matrix.sub(m, n);
```

**Result:**
```math
\mathbf{k} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  -3.0 & -11.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 & -6.0 \\
  12.0 & 6.0 & -10.0 & 6.0 & -1.0 \\

\end{bmatrix}
```

### <a name="scalar-mult" /> Scalar Multiplication

:book: **Wiki:** [Scalar Multiplication][scalar-mult]

**Example code:**
```java
// Construct new matrix
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 9, 6, 4 },
    { 2, 1, 5 }
});

// Operate scalar multiplication with the scalar equal to 5
// and create a new matrix as the resultant matrix
Matrix s = Matrix.mult(m, 5);
```

\begin{bmatrix}
  45.0 & 30.0 & 20.0 \\
  10.0 & 5.0 & 25.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

### <a name="matrix-mult" /> Matrix Multiplication

:book: **Wiki:** [Matrix Multiplication][matrix-mult]

> **Note**

**Example code:**
```java
// Create and construct new matrices
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 2, 2, 2, 2 },
    { 2, 2, 2, 2 }
});

Matrix n = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 4, 4 },
    { 4, 4 },
    { 4, 4 },
    { 4, 4 }
});

// Operate matrix multiplication for both matrices
// and create a new matrix as the resultant matrix
Matrix mn = Matrix.mult(m, n);
```

**Result:**
```math
\mathbf{mn} =
\begin{bmatrix}

**Result:**
```math
\mathbf{mT} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  1.0 & 5.0 \\
  2.0 & 6.0 \\
  3.0 & 7.0 \\
  4.0 & 8.0
\end{bmatrix}
```
