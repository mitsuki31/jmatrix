**JMatrix** is a lightweight [Java][java-wiki] library that provides essential matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and determinant calculation. Designed with simplicity in mind, it is perfect for educational purposes and small-scale projects involving [linear algebra][linear-algebra-wiki]. The library also supports custom matrix sizes and efficient handling of matrix operations for both square and rectangular matrices.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project was intended for educational purposes only. It is not recommended for use in large-scale projects.

**JMatrix** provides following basic matrix operations:

- [Addition][matrix-add]
- [Subtraction][matrix-sub]
- [Multiplication][matrix-mult]
- [Transposition][matrix-transpose]
- [Trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra))
- [Determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant)

In addition to the fundamental matrix operations, **JMatrix** also includes matrix type checkers, allowing users to identify certain characteristics of matrices:

- `isDiagonal`          - Check whether the matrix is [diagonal]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_matrix).
- `isSquare`            - Check whether the matrix is [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrix).
- `isLowerTriangular`   - Check whether the matrix is [lower triangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix).
- `isUpperTriangular`   - Check whether the matrix is [upper triangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix).
- `isPermutationMatrix` - Check whether the matrix is [permutation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_matrix).

## <a name="constructor-summary" /> Constructor Summary

There are five constructors available for constructing matrices in the **JMatrix** library. Each constructor serves a specific purpose, providing users with flexibility and ease of use.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are unfamiliar with matrices or need a refresher, you can check the [:bookmark:Introduction to Matrix][what-is-matrix] page to gain a basic understanding before delving into matrix constructors.

### <a name="cr_matrix-1" /> `Matrix()`

```java
public Matrix();
```

This constructor does not require any arguments and constructs a Matrix with null entries, resulting in a null matrix. A null matrix cannot perform any operations until it is initialized with valid elements. For example:

```java
// Create a null entries matrix
Matrix m = new Matrix();
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not confuse the **null matrix** with the **zero matrix**.
> A **null matrix** has null entries, whereas the **zero matrix** contains all elements as zeros.

> <details><summary><b>Examples</b></summary>
>
> #### Zero Matrix
>
> ```math
> \begin{bmatrix}
>   0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
>   0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0
> \end{bmatrix}_{2 \times 3}
> ```
>
> #### Null Matrix
>
> ```console
> null
> ```
>
> Yes, that is a **null matrix**. It has none or null entries inside the matrix. The output above is the result of this code below:
>
> ```java
> Matrix nullM = new Matrix();
> System.out.println(
>     (nullM.getEntries() == null) ? nullM.getEntries() : nullM.toString());
> ```
>
> Also if you use either the `display()` or `prettyDisplay()` method from null matrix, this output will be printed.
>
> ```console
> <null_matrix>
> ```
>
> </details> 


### <a name="cr_matrix-2" /> `Matrix(int, int)`

```java
public Matrix(int rows, int cols);
```

With this constructor, you can create a **zero matrix** with ease by providing two arguments: the number of [rows][matrix-row] and [columns][matrix-col]. A **zero matrix** contains all elements as zeros. For example:

```java
// Create null matrix with size 3x4
Matrix m = new Matrix(3, 4);
```

The code above constructs a new **zero matrix** with size $3 \times 4$. The matrix will looks like this:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

### <a name="cr_matrix-3" /> `Matrix(int, int, double)`

```java
public Matrix(int rows, int cols, double val);
```

This constructor is similar to [`Matrix(int, int)`](#cr_matrix-2) but with an additional argument that sets the value for all elements of the constructed matrix. For example:

```java
// Create a new matrix with size 4x4 and set all elements to 5.0
Matrix m = new Matrix(4, 4, 5);
```

The constructed matrix will looks like this:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 \\
  5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 \\
  5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 \\
  5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0 & 5.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

### <a name="cr_matrix-4" /> `Matrix(double[][])`

```java
public Matrix(double[][] arr);
```

This constructor is **highly recommended** for constructing a new [matrix][what-is-matrix]. You can declare the entries first and then convert them into a **Matrix** object whenever needed.

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note, this constructor only accepts two-dimensional array with type of `double`.

For example:

```java
// Declare and initialize entries "a"
double[][] a = {
    { 1, 2, 3 },
    { 4, 5, 6 }
};

// Convert to Matrix
Matrix m = new Matrix(a);
```

Alternatively, you can directly create a new matrix using this code:

```java
// Create new matrix
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 1, 2, 3 },
    { 4, 5, 6 }
});
```

### <a name="cr_matrix-5" /> `Matrix.identity(int)`

```java
public static Matrix identity(int n);
```

This constructor creates a new **identity matrix** with a size of $n \times n$ (where $n$ is a non-floating number). An **identity matrix** is a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere, often denoted as $I$.

Please avoid using $I$ or $i$ as variable names for matrices in code, as $i$ is commonly used in `for-loop` statements. Instead, consider using $mI$ or a similar alternative. For instance:

```java
// Create new identity matrix with size 5x5
Matrix mI = Matrix.identity(5);
```

The matrix will looks like this:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 \\
  0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 1.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

## <a name="matrix-ops" /> Matrix Operations

The **JMatrix** library provides several basic matrix operations that allow users to perform common matrix calculations with ease. These operations include:

- [Addition](#matrix-add)
- [Subtraction](#matrix-sub)
- [Scalar Multiplication](#scalar-mult)
- [Matrix Multiplication](#matrix-mult)
- [Transposition](#matrix-transpose)
- [Trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra))
- [Determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant)

For more detailed information about each matrix operation, you can refer to the [:books: JMatrix Wiki][matrix-ops].

### <a name="matrix-add" /> Addition

```java
public void sum(Matrix m);
```
```java
public static Matrix sum(Matrix m, Matrix n);
```
```java
public void sum(double[][] a);
```
```java
public static double[][] sum(double[][] a, double[][] b);
```

:book: **Wiki:** [Matrix Addition][matrix-add]

In **matrix addition**, two matrices with the same dimensions are added together element-wise. Each element of the resulting matrix is the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input matrices.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before performing **matrix addition**, ensure that the two matrices have the same dimensions (in other words, square matrix).

**Example code:**

```java
// Construct new matrices
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 6, 7, 0, 1 },
    { 2, 6, 1, 8 }
});

Matrix n = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 1, 9, 3, -4 },
    { 7, 1, -1, 5 }
});

// Perform addition for both matrices and
// create a new matrix as the resultant matrix
Matrix k = Matrix.sum(m, n);
```

**Result:**

```math
\mathbf{k} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  7.0 & 16.0 & 3.0 & -3.0 \\
  9.0 & 7.0 & 0.0 & 13.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

In the example above, two matrices $m$ and $n$ are created. The `Matrix.sum(m, n)` method is used to add both matrices element-wise, and the resulting matrix $k$ is computed and stored. The output matrix $k$ is the sum of matrices $m$ and $n$.

### <a name="matrix-sub" /> Subtraction

```java
public void sub(Matrix m);
```
```java
public static Matrix sub(Matrix m, Matrix n);
```
```java
public void sub(double[][] a);
```
```java
public static double[][] sub(double[][] a, double[][] b);
```

:book: **Wiki:** [Matrix Subtraction][matrix-sub]

**Matrix subtraction** involves subtracting corresponding elements of one matrix from another.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before performing **matrix subtraction**, ensure that the two matrices have the same dimensions (in other words, square matrix).

**Example code:**

```java
// Construct new matrices
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 1, -5, 8, -2, 3 },
    { 2, 12, -2, 7, 0 },
    { 6, 7, 9, 1, -5 }
});

Matrix n = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 4, 6, 8, -3, 9 },
    { -10, 6, 8, 1, 1 },
    { 6, -7, 2, 3, 5 }
});

// Perform subtraction for both matrices and
// create a new matrix as the resultant matrix
Matrix k = Matrix.sub(m, n);
```

**Result:**

```math
\mathbf{k} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  -3.0 & -11.0 & 0.0 & 1.0 & -6.0 \\
  12.0 & 6.0 & -10.0 & 6.0 & -1.0 \\
  0.0 & 14.0 & 7.0 & -2.0 & -10.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

In the example above, two matrices $m$ and $n$ are created. The `Matrix.sub(m, n)` method is used to subtract $n$ from $m$ element-wise, and the resulting matrix $k$ is computed and stored. The output matrix $k$ is the difference between matrices $m$ and $n$.

### <a name="scalar-mult" /> Scalar Multiplication

```java
public void mult(double x);
```
```java
public static Matrix mult(Matrix m, double x);
```

:book: **Wiki:** [Scalar Multiplication][scalar-mult]

**Scalar multiplication** involves multiplying all elements of a matrix by a scalar value. The resulting matrix will have each of its elements multiplied by the given scalar value.

> [!NOTE]  
> The resulting matrix's sizes of **scalar multiplication** will be always the same with the sizes of the operand matrix.

**Example code:**

```java
// Construct new matrix
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 9, 6, 4 },
    { 2, 1, 5 }
});

// Perform scalar multiplication with the scalar equal to 5
// and create a new matrix as the resultant matrix
Matrix s = Matrix.mult(m, 5);
```

**Result:**

```math
\mathbf{s} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  45.0 & 30.0 & 20.0 \\
  10.0 & 5.0 & 25.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

In the example above, a matrix $m$ is created. The `Matrix.mult(m, 5)` method is used to multiply each element of matrix $m$ by the scalar value $5$, resulting in a new matrix $s$.

### <a name="matrix-mult" /> Matrix Multiplication

```java
public void mult(Matrix m);
```
```java
public static Matrix mult(Matrix m, Matrix n);
```
```java
public void mult(double[][] a);
```
```java
public static double[][] mult(double[][] a, double[][] b);
```

:book: **Wiki:** [Matrix Multiplication][matrix-mult]

**Matrix multiplication** involves multiplying two matrices together following a specific rule.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before performing **matrix multiplication**, ensure the number of [columns][matrix-col] in the first matrix must be equal to the number of [rows][matrix-row] in the second matrix.

**Example code:**

```java
// Create and construct new matrices
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 2, 2, 2, 2 },
    { 2, 2, 2, 2 }
});

Matrix n = new Matrix(new double[][] {
    { 4, 4 },
    { 4, 4 },
    { 4, 4 },
    { 4, 4 }
});

// Operate matrix multiplication for both matrices
// and create a new matrix as the resultant matrix
Matrix mn = Matrix.mult(m, n);
```

**Result:**
```math
\mathbf{mn} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  32.0 & 32.0 \\
  32.0 & 32.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

In the example above, two matrices $m$ and $n$ are created. The `Matrix.mult(m, n)` method is used to perform **matrix multiplication** between matrices $m$ and $n$, resulting in a new matrix $mn$.


### <a name="matrix-transpose" /> Transposition

```java
public void transpose();
```
```java
public static Matrix transpose(Matrix m);
```
```java
public static double[][] transpose(double[][] a);
```

:book: **Wiki:** [Matrix Transposition][matrix-transpose]

**Matrix transposition** involves swapping the [rows][matrix-row] and [columns][matrix-col] of a matrix. The resulting matrix will have its rows and columns interchanged.

> [!NOTE]  
> üí° **Tip:** Repeating this operation to the transposed matrix will reset their indices position to the original position.

**Example code:**

```java
// Create and construct new matrix
Matrix m = new Matrix (new double[][] {
    { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
    { 5, 6, 7, 8 }
});

// Transpose the matrix and create a new matrix
// to store the transposed matrix
Matrix mT = Matrix.transpose(m);
```

**Result:**

```math
\mathbf{mT} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  1.0 & 5.0 \\
  2.0 & 6.0 \\
  3.0 & 7.0 \\
  4.0 & 8.0
\end{bmatrix}
```

In the example above, a matrix $m$ is created. The `Matrix.transpose(m)` method is used to transpose matrix $m$, resulting in a new matrix $mT$ with the [rows][matrix-row] and [columns][matrix-col] interchanged.
